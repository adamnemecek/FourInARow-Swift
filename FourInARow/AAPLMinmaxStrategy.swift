        Heuristic: the chance of winning soon is related to the number and length
        of N-in-a-row runs of chips. For example, a player with two runs of two chips each
        is more likely to win soon than a player with no runs.
        
        Scoring should weigh the player's chance of success against that of failure,
        which in a two-player game means success for the opponent. Sum the player's number
        and size of runs, and subtract from it the same score for the opponent.
        
        This is not the best possible heuristic for Four-In-A-Row, but it produces
        moderately strong gameplay. Try these improvements:
        - Account for "broken runs"; e.g. a row of two chips, then a space, then a third chip.
        - Weight the run lengths; e.g. two runs of three is better than three runs of two.
